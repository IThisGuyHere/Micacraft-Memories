Welcome to Micahcraft Memories. This pack contains structures from past Micahcraft servers (1.14-1.19 as of 1/3/2024) that had significant effort put into them and
were reasonable to generate in the world.

Structures made by people who are no longer part of the server are included in the pack, but not generated naturally by default. They will be enabled if
the structure name is added to the micahcraft structure_set and structure tag (ex: "mica_mem:aliceothers_wood_village_1-17")

Examples of structures that are NOT included: long wooden rectangle with no decoration, village base with little to no major changes, most cave bases (hard to generate),
structures with a radius larger than 116 blocks (impossible to generate without weird workarounds)

Some files in this pack were generated using Misode's datapack generators, found here: https://misode.github.io/
