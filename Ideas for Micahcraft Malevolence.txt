name is WIP

City:
-claimed by pillagers
-massive to-scale banners hanging from every building
-miniboss on every tower roof
-ocean tower is flooded, filled with pillagers riding guardians that spawn from chunks of the floors jutting out from the wall (use trial spawner?)
	also has conduit(s) hidden to give water breathing but are destroyed when broken
-center house has vindicator riding one of the llamas (llamin?)
-pillagers are scared to go near Exterminator Male Whistling Death Adult
-sheep in nether tower are tanked
-maybe forest tower has tree branches wrapped around it and the player climbs along them like the locations in NW
-use an illusioner somewhere?
-end tower has pillagers with tipped arrows of levitation that only last 1/2 sec (to disorient)
-vindicators in nether tower can have fire aspect on their weapons

Amogus Beach:
-no longer a beach, but on top of a massive crewmate floating in the ocean
-"vents" go down into the crewmate's suit
-inside the crewmate helmet, have a table with zombies (or something) colored to represent the suit colors (some have swords because imposter)

Beach Town:
-portal is a big part of this one
-piglins invaded and took over the base
-used "nether spreaders" like in dungeons to keep from dying in overworld
-several smaller portals around the area with the massive portal being the most heavily guarded
-each portal has hidden trial spawners that spawn piglins like they are coming from the portal (these ones cannot survive and will become zombies, but not immediately)
-each building takes on a nether style and is reinforced

Jungle Bridge Base (if it can be copied):
-spawn poison skeletons in treetops

Tweety Unfinished Castle:
-not unfinished but destroyed
-overtaken by sculk
-weaker warden inside that does not drop catalyst
